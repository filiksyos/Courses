# 🤖 AI Explorer - Interactive Learning Course

An engaging, interactive crash course designed to help you master AI fundamentals in just 10 minutes using proven psychological learning techniques!

## 🧠 Learning Psychology Features

This app implements several instant-effect psychological principles:

### ✨ **Dual Coding Theory**
- Every concept pairs text with memorable visuals (emojis, diagrams, mnemonic images)
- Activates both verbal and visual memory pathways

### 🧩 **Chunking**
- Complex AI topics broken into micro-chunks (one concept per screen)
- Each chunk can be completed in 30-60 seconds

### 🎯 **Gamification**
- Drag-and-drop interactions for active learning
- Instant feedback with animations and color changes
- Confetti effects for correct answers

### 🔗 **Peg Word Method**
- Memorable associations for each concept (e.g., "BFS = RIPPLES", "DFS = DRILL")
- Silly, vivid imagery that sticks in memory

### ⚡ **Active Recall**
- Immediate quizzes after each micro-chunk
- Random challenge button for surprise testing

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧩 Problem Solving
- What is a Problem? (States, goals, actions)
- Elements of Well-Defined Problems (ISOG: Initial state, Successor function, gOal test, path Cost)
- Problem Types (Single-state, Multiple-state, Contingency, Exploration)
- Problem Formulation Process (GAPS: Goal, Abstraction, Path finding, Solution execution)
- Practice with 8-Puzzle

### 🔍 Uninformed Search
- What is Search? (GPS analogy)
- Search Trees and Components (FAMILY tree analogy)
- Algorithm Components (GTC: Generator, Tester, Closed/Open lists)
- BFS vs DFS (RIPPLES vs DRILL)
- Algorithm Analysis (COTS: Completeness, Optimality, Time, Space)

### 🧠 Machine Learning
- ML Definition (PTE: Performance, Task, Experience)
- When to Use ML (CHEB: Complex, Huge data, Environment changes, Brain-like)
- Big Data and ML (3 Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety)
- Classification and Decision Trees (MAIL SORTING analogy)

- **⌨️ Keyboard Navigation** - Arrow keys and Escape for efficiency

## 💡 Memory Techniques Used

### Problem Solving
- **Problem = GAP**: Current state to Goal state with Actions and Plans
- **SOME**: Single-state, Observable partially = Multiple-state, Maybe works = Contingency, Exploration
- **ISOG**: Initial state, Successor function, gOal test, path Cost
- **GAPS**: Goal formulation, Abstraction/Problem formulation, Path finding/Search, Solution execution

### Uninformed Search
- **Search = GPS**: Goal state, Path finding, States
- **Tree = FAMILY**: Root (grandparent), Branch (parent-child), Leaf (youngest kids), Goal (family reunion)
- **GTC**: Generator, Tester, Closed vs OPEN (done vs to-do)
- **BFS = RIPPLES** (spreads outward), **DFS = DRILL** (goes deep)
- **COTS**: Completeness, Optimality, Time complexity, Space complexity

### Machine Learning
- **ML = PTE**: Performance improves with Task and Experience
- **CHEB**: Complex to program, Huge data available, Environment changes, Brain can do it but can't explain
- **3 Vs**: Volume (vast), Velocity (very fast), Variety (various types)
- **Classification = MAIL SORTING**: Features = address details, Classes = delivery zones

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No frameworks needed
- **Mermaid.js** - For interactive diagrams
- **Responsive Grid Layout** - Mobile-friendly
- **Local Storage Ready** - Easy to extend with progress tracking
- **Modular Data Structure** - Easy to add new topics
