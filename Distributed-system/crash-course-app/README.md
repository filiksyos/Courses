# 🚀 Distributed Systems Explorer

An interactive crash course designed to help you learn distributed systems concepts in just 10 minutes using proven psychological learning techniques!

## 🧠 Learning Psychology Used

This app implements several instant-effect psychological principles:

### ✨ **Dual Coding Theory**
- Every concept pairs text with memorable visuals (icons, diagrams, mnemonic images)

- Each chunk can be completed in 30-60 seconds

### 🎯 **Gamification**
- Drag-and-drop interactions for active learning
- Instant feedback with animations and color changes
- Confetti effects for correct answers

### 🔗 **Peg Word Method**
- Memorable associations for each concept (e.g., "TTL = Milk expiration date")
- Silly, vivid imagery that sticks in memory

### ⚡ **Active Recall**
- Immediate quizzes after each micro-chunk
- Random challenge button for surprise testing
